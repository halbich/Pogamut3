/**
 * This is root of POSH plan in execution sense. In source of POSH plan, this is
 * leaf of root. Every POSH plan can have only one DriveCollection.
 * <p/>
 * drive collection: this is the root of the POSH hierarchy, and on every POSH
 * action-selection cycle, this reconsiders which goal the agent should be
 * working on. This is how a BOD agent can respond rapidly to changes in the
 * environment.
 * <p/>
 * <b>How does it work?</b> Fact: Engine remembers which node of the drive it
 * processed last time. When engine evaluates the drive, it starts evaluation in
 * the place, where it left off in the last evaluation of drive. Engine
 * evaluates the plan each tick, but it doesn't matter if drive was evaluated in
 * previsous tick or 10000 ticks ago (e.g. trigger of the drive was unsatisfied
 * for a long time), engine will take the state (state=path from the drive to
 * some node in the drive tree) it was left off last time and goes from there,
 * e.g. if drive was evaluating which action it should do, it will continue to
 * do so, if drive was executing some action, it will continue in its execution.
 * <p/>
 * By "will continue in..." is meant "will try to continue...", because in many
 * cases, it will fail(the action will signal its failure ect.), but it doesn't
 * matter, in such case the engine will traverse the drive's decision tree from
 * the root. Originally it was supposed to enable quick switch to some action
 * and go back to doing whatever the original drive was doing. Not sure about
 * how useful it is.
 *
 * @see Competence Competences are similar, but slightly different. There is a
 * lot of confusion about how they differ from DC, so take a look.
