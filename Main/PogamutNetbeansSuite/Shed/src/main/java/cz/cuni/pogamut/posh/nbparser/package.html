        <p>This package contains classes responsible on-the-fly parsing of Yaposh plan in text view. 
            This package contains two factories instantiated by layer.xml. The <code>NbPoshParserFactory</code> creates parser that parses the Yaposh plans in the text view of the Shed. The <code>SyntaxErrorsHighlightingTaskFactory</code> creates a task that accepts parsing results form the parser and adds error notification to the text view.
            The syntax errors of the plan look like little red exclamation mark on the right side of the text view, it has tooltip with full text of syntax error.</p>
