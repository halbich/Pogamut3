      This is package for storing stuff for classes of properties (Node.Property)
      of various properties used by sposh.
      <br/>
      A lot of code is bloatware (not my fault, blame... Tulach, I guess).

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      ParameterProperty is the core property used by the Property API. 
      ParameterProperty is using custom editor (ParameterEditor) thanks to ParameterProperty#getPropertyEditor().
      ParameterEditor has some functions, but above all it can deliver custom editor, but
      normal custom editor are boring and user unfriendly (they appear in the middle of screen), so we want
      inplace editor. That requires a bit of work, but thanks to bridge ParameterInplaceEditor, it is possible.
      The bridge has ParameterEditor at one end, ParameterEditorPanel at the other end.
