	Draws colored staying debug lines in UT2004. Note that these lines may be erased by ALT + G command as well! Drawing works as follows: Two vectors from attribute Vectors are read and line with the specified color is drawn between them, then again two another vectors are read, etc. If there are not enough vectors in the list, line won't be drawn. Color is in RGB format - 0 to 255. ClearAll set to true clears all staying debug lines before drawing (new lines still be drawn if supplied).
