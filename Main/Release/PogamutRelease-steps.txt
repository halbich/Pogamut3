0) run package.bat (will build this project)

0.1) alter const.bat to match current settings

0.2) Checkout fresh svn://artemis.ms.mff.cuni.cz/pogamut into some DIFFERENT dir (one you specify in const.bat) 
... MAKE SURE THAT NOONE WILL INTERFERE WITH YOUR OPERATION (i.e., inside SVN, NO COMMITS!)
... ALWAYS PERFORM THE RELEASE ON DIFFERENT DIRECTORY THAN ONE, YOU HAVE Pogamut-Release checked out in

1) Make sure that there are no new archetypes available, if so,
   change step0 / step2 / step3 / step4 / step5 / step10 / step11 xmls to correctly refresh & deploy them
   
2) Make sure that there are no new projects to be included in the release, if so
   change all stepX.xml accordingly
   
3) Make sure that all archetypes still have very simple layout ... i.e., single source file / single resource
   THERE MUST BE NO NESTED DIRECTORIES IN (example):
   Main\PogamutUT2004Examples\00-EmptyBot\target\generated-sources\archetype\src\main\resources\archetype-resources\src\main\java
     
4) If you are about to do FULL RELEASE goto (5),
   if you are about to release LIBRARIES ONLY goto (6)

================
(5) FULL RELEASE
================

5.1) Perform all stepXX in directoy "release-all".

5.2) Installers can be found in Main/Installer/target

5.3) Update archetype-catalog.xml inside the artifactory manually:

    Follow Archetypes\__HELP__\archetype-catalog-update\readme.txt and add archetypes for the release + new snapshots.
    ... this means you have to update two catalogs (snapshot & release catalog separately)

==========================
(6) LIBRARIES ONLY RELEASE
==========================

6.1) Perform all stepXX in directoy "release-libs-only".

6.2) Update archetype-catalog.xml inside the artifactory manually:

    Follow Archetypes\__HELP__\archetype-catalog-update\readme.txt and add archetypes for the release + new snapshots.
    ... this means you have to update two catalogs (snapshot & release catalog separately)
